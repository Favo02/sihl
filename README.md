# Sihl

Sihl aims to be a Rails or Django for [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/). It is a high-level Reason web framework that makes development fun and safe.

Documentation is in the making, check out this [example project](https://github.com/oxidizing/sihl-example-issues) meanwhile.

## Installation

Install Sihl as NPM package `yarn add @sihl/core`.

You can install the users app as well to have user management out of the box `yarn add @sihl/users`.

## Why Reason?

The [official documentation](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/what-and-why#why-reason) explains it better than we ever could.

## Features

* Familiar and Safe: Reason looks a lot like JavaScript at first sight, but a powerful compiler is having your back
* Modular Architecture: Just like with [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/applications/#module-django.apps), Sihl projects comprise of small self-contained apps
* Admin UI: Your admins will love you for giving them UIs using Sihl's unified mechanism to create them
* Opinionated: Sihl demands you to do a few things the certain way which gives your project structure
* Persistence Agnostic: Your know how you want to handle your data, Sihl doesn't ship an ORM
* Node.js Ecosystem: Reason compiles to JavaScript, you can keep using the libraries you already know and love!
* Full Stack by Design:
