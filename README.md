# Sihl

Sihl is a high-level ReasonML web application framework that makes development fun and safe. It provides tools, conventions and patterns to quickly ramp up your next project without sacrificing long-term maintanability.

## Features

* Familiar and safe: ReasonML looks familiar to JavaScript (ES6+) developers while providing safety through strict type checks without writing type annotations, let the compiler do the work for you!
* Modular architecture: Sihl projects are composed of small and self-contained Sihl apps
* Admin UI: Unified way of creating UIs for admins easily using server side rendered React
* Opinionated: Sihl gives your app structure and guides you through the development process
* Node.js ecosystem: ReasonML compiles down to JavaScript, so you can keep using the libraries you are familiar with!
* Persistence agnostic: Your know how you want to handle your data, Sihl doesn't ship an ORM
