Sihl is a framework for OCaml and Reason with the goal to make web development fun and safe by turning run-time bugs into compile-time bugs.

While we are working on finishing up the first public release, check out this [example project](https://github.com/oxidizing/sihl-example-issues).

## Documentation

[Documentation](https://oxidizing.github.io/sihl-docs/sihl/index.html) is heavily WIP but always in sync with the current master branch. It gives a good overview of the scope of the framework.

## Status of the project

We are finishing up the APIs for the first public release. Nevertheless we have [one project](https://oxidizing.io/#projects) in production that uses Sihl.
