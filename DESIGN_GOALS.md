# Design goals

## Developer happiness

This design goal is inspired by Ruby's design goal of making the developer happy.

## Familiarity

The expectations of developers who are familiar with the basic principles of functional programming should not get broken.

## Rapid development without sacrificing maintanability

It should be possible to develop applications reasonably fast without taking up a lot of technical debt. Development velocity should be kept up in the long run.

## Guided Composability

Instead of being stuck on rails, it should be possible to build things by composing smaller things. That process should be guided.
